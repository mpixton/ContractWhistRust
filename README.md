# Overview
This project is an implementation of the game Contract Whist (also known as Oh Heck, Oh Hell, Mormon Bridge, or Oh Snap) 
in the programming language Rust. 

# Implementation Details
The implementation contains multiple instances of the type state pattern in Rust using structs and traits to define behavior. 
Type state is a powerful pattern that prevents code from being isused by accidentally using a method or function at a point 
in time when it is invalid to do so.
